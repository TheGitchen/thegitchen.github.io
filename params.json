{"name":"The Gitchen","tagline":"Open Source Cooking Code","body":"### Welcome to Gitchen.org\r\n\r\nIn June 2014, the founders of [Food52.com](http://www.food52.com/) issued a challenge to create a [Github for Home Cooking](http://www.foodtechconnect.com/2014/06/25/github-for-home-cooking-food52s-vision-for-hacking-dining/). I’ve taken up the beginnings of that challenge with this open source repository where anyone can browse or contribute cooking-related code.\r\n\r\n### Cooking Units\r\n\r\nThe first addition to the site is a simple Javascript library called [CookingUnits](https://github.com/TheGitchen/CookingUnits) that helps with ingredient conversions. Sure, you can get basic unit conversions in a [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+tsp+in+a+gallon), but this library provides additional features unique to cooking. First, it has a framework for converting ingredients from weight to volume (invaluable for bakers) and it also formats your numbers using HTML-based fractions. Why tell someone to add 1.667 cups when 1 ⅔ cups more closely matches your measuring cups?\r\n\r\n### Contribute!\r\nThe goal of Gitchen.org is to have a single destination on Github where you can find a collection of cooking-related repositories, so we'd love if you would consider including your open source repositories in our organization.  Gitchen.org is not a company and you retain all the rights and ownership of your code and can remove it from gitchen.org at any time.  It's about making these types of utilities easier to find for everyone building cooking software.\r\n\r\n### Questions?\r\nWe're just getting started, so if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me (@wubbahed).\r\n","google":"UA-44557527-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
